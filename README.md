Kaggle competition : Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting, etc.

for Feature Engineering (imputation / encoding) I have used Feature-Engine library and set up it with sklearn Pipeline.
Also hyperparameter tunning is done for this pipeline using GridSearchCV cross-validation technique.
